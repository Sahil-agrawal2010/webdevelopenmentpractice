DOM stands for docunment object module.
It is a programming interface that allows javascript to intract with html and css - So that scripts can read , modify and controll the structure, style and content of a webpage or a website.
Think of it like this : html builds the house , css decorates the house and javascript controlls the light , doors and everthing inside.
So , When a webpage is looaded the browser converts the html into a tree like a structure and that's the DOM tree.



How browser creats DOM?
1)The browser downloads your html file.
2)It parses the html from top to bottom.
3)Every tag becomes an object (node) in memory.
4)These nodes are linked together forming a DOM tree.
5)Javascript can then use the docunment object to access and modify these node.


DOM tree visualization:- Each html elements becomes a node in a tree:-
1)Root node:-<html></html>.
2)Branch nodes:-<head></head> , <body></body> , <div></div> etc.
3)Leaf nodes:-text contains inside tags.
